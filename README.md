## Run

Thanks to [Sequencer](https://github.com/sequencer), 
this project is integrated in [`rocket-playground` environment](https://github.com/sequencer/rocket-playground), 
you can clone the whole environment and run inside, or you can only test the module under `ClusterGroup`.

### Clone Rocket-Playground With This Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SingularityKChen/rocket-playground.git --recurse-submodules
cd rocket-chip/
mill mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea
```

And then you can develop and test this project in Intellij.

### Install Mill

You can install `mill` manual or [other methods](http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/)

```bash
sudo su
curl -L https://github.com/lihaoyi/mill/releases/download/0.6.1/0.6.1 > /usr/local/bin/mill
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mill
```

### Generate an IntelliJ Project Config

After cloning it with `--recurse-submodules`, you can use `mill` in idea after this command:

```bash
mill mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea
```

If you meet any similar error as bellow shows, you can check the `mill` version, and then [install the newest version of `mill`](#Install-Mill).

![mill gen idea config errors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SingularityKChen/PicUpload/master/img/20200306100848%20mill%20idea%20error.jpg)

If your mill can not find some `build.sc` files under `firrtl`, `chisel3`, etc., then you need to clone the submodules as well.

## TODO

You can find it at [the project page](https://github.com/SingularityKChen/dl_accelerator/projects/1).

## Known Bugs

+ Meet continuous zero \(more than three\) columns in weight matrix;
+ The head of address vectors or data vectors is zero column;

## [Modelling](./dla/tests/src/ScalaModelTest.scala)

I tried to write a Scala model for Eyeriss to get the performance. Notice: I use CSC data format not only in scratch pads but also inAct SRAMs.

## [Elaboration](./dla/src)

### [Processing Element](./dla/src/pe)

This is the original fundamental component of deep learning accelerator and the PE in this project is [a little different](#Some-Differences).

![PE Top Architecture](./diagrams/ProcessingElement.png)


At SPad for loops, the row number of the 2D partial sum matrix is `M0`, the column number of it is `F0*N0*E`, the size of partial sum matrix is must less than the size of PSumSPad, which equals to `pSumDataSPadSize`.

The original size of 2D input activation matrix is `(R*C0, F0*N0*E)`, the size of 2D weight matrix is `(M0, R*C0)`. Due to the compressed [data format](#Compressed-Sparse-Column-Data-Format), both input activation matrix and weight matrix can be stored in a smaller SPad.

All three kinds of data are stored in the column's order, i.e., partial sum store the first `M0` elements, then second until `F0*N0*E` elements.

#### Some Differences

The original one use CSC format, but I changed it for convenience. More details can be found [later](#Compressed-Sparse-Column-Data-Format).

#### ProcessingElementControl

This is the control module of PE.

#### ProcessingElementPad

This is the Scratch Pad of input feature map, filter weight and partial sum. It contains seven stages. This module is similar to the graph bellow, expect the FIFOs.

![Eyeriss v2 PE Architecture. The address SPad for both inAct and weight are used to store addr vector in the CSC compressed data, while the data SPad stores the data and count vectors](https://images-cdn.shimo.im/Zj7Aa6YzIis6Fhxs/image.png)

The most complex part is the computation state machine.

This is used for debug at PE top level. It generates two sub IOs to get the signal through from control module and Scratch Pad module.

##### PEControlDebugIO

This is used for monitoring control module to top module.

+ peState: know the state of the state machine, idle, load or calculation;
+ doMACEnDebug: this signal can be seen as the start signal of MAC, so we need to keep an eye on it;

### [Cluster](./dla/src/cluster)

#### [Cluster Group](./dla/src/cluster/ClusterGroup.scala)

This is the top module of cluster group. It contains one GLB cluster, one Router cluster, one PE cluster and the cluster group control module.

![Cluster Group Architecture](./diagrams/ClusterGroup.png)

#### [GLB Cluster](./dla/src/cluster/GLBCluster.scala)

This is the global buffer cluster module. It contains `inActSRAMNum` input activation SRAM banks, `pSumSRAMNum` partial sum SRAM banks.

##### InActSRAMBank

You need to poke the value of `g2*N2*C2*(F2 + S2) + n2*C2*(F2 + S2) + c2*(F2 + S2) + (f2 + s2)` when reading input activation. Then it will find the real address of input activation's SRAM bank via a lookup table. However, when writing, you don't need to poke any address. It will send back `done` signal to other module when read finishes or write finishes.

##### PSumSRAMBank

You have to poke address into partial sum SRAM banks no matter you want to read or write it. The address will be directly sent to the SRAM, which means it's the address of the SRAM.

#### [PE Cluster](./dla/src/cluster/PECluster.scala)

This is the processing element cluster module. It is a PE Array which contains `peArrayColumnNum` columns and `peArrayRowNum` rows, also it needs a inAct controller to make things tidy.

![PE Cluster Architecture](./diagrams/PECLuster.png)

  - `OutIOs(1)`: send the data to its only horizontal neighboring WeightRouter;
- ctrlPath
  - inSelWire: false enables `inIOs(0)` and true enables `inIOs(1)`
  - OutSelWire: always send to `outIOs(0)` and this signal be true to enables `outIOs(1)`

#### [Cluster Config](./dla/src/cluster/ClusterConfig.scala)

This file contains some basic static parameters needed in the Cluster Group.

### [EyerissWrapper](./dla/src/eyerissWrapper)

#### [ClusterGroupWrapper](./dla/src/eyerissWrapper/ClusterGroupWrapper.scala)

This module is used to wrap cluster group, as I didn't connect all the cluster groups together. So in the future, if I want to connect them together, then I can simple replace the cluster group with a bigger once inside this wrapper. Also, it contains CSC switchers, which can compress the data.

![Cluster Group Architecture](./diagrams/EyerissWrapper.png)

#### [CSCSwitcher](./dla/src/eyerissWrapper/CSCSwitcher.scala)

This module is used to compress matrix into [optimised CSC data format](#Compressed-Sparse-Column-Data-Format).

+ inData: flipped decoupled IO, this is the uncompressed original data.
+ outData:
  + adrIO: decoupled IO, this is the compressed address vector.
  + dataIO: decoupled IO. this is the compressed data vector and count vector.
+ ctrlPath: input only
  + matrixHeight: the height of one matrix.
  + matrixWidth: the width of one matrix.
  + vectorNum: the number of matrix, as we need `0` to be the ending flag.
  
### [Diplomatic](./dla/src/diplomatic)

When we want to integrate Eyeriss into SoC, then we need some more things. The diagram bellow shows the architecture of Eyeriss SoC.

![Eyeriss SoC](./diagrams/EyerissSoC.png)

#### [EyerissTop](./dla/src/diplomatic/EyerissTop.scala)

This module wrap the eyeriss wrapper, the decoder and the memory controller together, then we can verify it as in SoC environment.

![Eyeriss Top Architecture](./diagrams/EyerissTop.png)

#### [EyerissDecoder](./dla/src/diplomatic/EyerissDecoder.scala)

This module can decode the instructions from CPU and outputs some config data and control signals.

+ instruction: input, the instructions from CPU
+ calFin: input, true when pSum load finish
+ valid: output, true at one cycle later after pSum load finish
+ doMacEn: output, true when all config instructions have received, then can begin computing.
+ inActIO: input only
  + starAdr: the start address of input activations
  + reqSize: the number of elements that receive from memory at one time.
+ weightIO: input only
  + starAdr: the start address of weight
  + reqSize: the number of elements that receive from memory at one time.
+ pSumIO:
  + starAdr: input, the start address of partial sum
  + reqSize: input, the number of elements that receive from memory at one time.
  + pSumLoadEn: output, true to load PSum from GLB to memory.

#### [MemCtrl](./dla/src/diplomatic/MemCtrl.scala)

This module is used to control the process of read and write from memory. 
This module can generate the address, sourceId, which are used in TileLink get/put. 
Also, it's able to manage all the source id.

+ inActIO, weightIO, pSumIO:
  + address: output, address of the first element of the current matrix
  + sourceAlloc: decoupled IO, output the source id of current requirement.
  + sourceFree: flipped decoupled IO, input the source id that have received the response.
  + startAdr: input, the start address
  + reqSize: input, the number of elements that receive from memory at one time.
    It should less than the size of the GLB SRAM.

## [Tests](./dla/tests/src)

## Instruction Set

### OpCode

As the opcode map of [RISC-V user 2.2](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/blob/riscv-user-2.2/src/opcode-map.tex) shows, 
I choose the custom space of `custom-1`, so the opcode is `01_010_11`.
If I use `RoCC` interface, I have to use the following instructions: 

  | `INSTRUCTIONS` | `funct7` | `rs2` | `rs1` | `xd` \& `xs1` \& `xs2` | `rd`  | `opcode` |
  | -------------- | -------- | ----- | ----- | ---------------------- | ----- | -------- |
  | `LoadPSum` | 0000000 | ????? | ????? | 001                    | ????? | 0101011  |
  | `InActWeiAddr` | 0000001  | ????? | ????? | 110                    | ????? | 0101011  |
  | `G2N2M2F2` | 0000010  | ????? | ????? | 110                    | ????? | 0101011  |
  | `C2S2G1N1` | 0000011  | ????? | ????? | 110                    | ????? | 0101011  |
  | `M1F1C1S1` | 0000100  | ????? | ????? | 110                    | ????? | 0101011  |
  | `F0N0C0M0` | 0000101  | ????? | ????? | 110                    | ????? | 0101011  |
  | `E&R` | 0000110  | ????? | ????? | 110                    | ????? | 0101011  |

However, if I decide to get the configurations and instructions via mapped register, then the instruction set can be more flexible. 
I try to design the instruction set based on **I-type**.

| `INSTRUCTIONS` | `imm[11:0]` | `rs1` | `func3` | `rd` | `opcode`|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LoadPart0` | `G2N2M2F2` | `inActAdr` | 000 | `weightAdr` | 0101011 |
| `LoadPart1` | `C2S2G1N1` | --- | 001 | --- | 0101011 |
| `LoadPart2` | `M1F1C1S1` | --- | 010 | --- | 0101011 |
| `LoadPart3` | `F0N0C0M0` | `E` | 011 |`R` | 0101011 |
| `LoadPSum` | --- | --- | 100 | `PSumAdr` | 0101011 |

## Data Flow And Data Format

### Row-Stationary Plus \(RS+\) DataFlow

The figure bellow shows the data flow of Row Stationary Plus, and you can find it at ref.3.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SingularityKChen/PicUpload/master/img/20200312231702.png)

And the figure bellow is the data flow of Row Stationary, you will find more information at ref.1.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SingularityKChen/PicUpload/master/img/20200311220756.png)

However, when I tried to map the Row Stationary Plus data flow into a graph like Row Stationary's, 
I found that we are supposed to accumulate each partial sum columns rather than rows, because in RS+, 
we have done each row in SPad Level, i.e., the for loop of `E` and `R`.

So we can get the graphs bellow.

At SPad level, we will calculate all rows of weights and partial sums, so we don't have to care about this dimension at other levels.

![EyerissV2 SPad Level](./diagrams/row-stationary-01.jpg)

At Noc level, all kinds of data will be mapped in to PE array at same time, 
and regard the PEs which will produce the same column of partial sums as one group.

![EyerissV2 NoC Level](./diagrams/row-stationary-02.jpg)

At Global Buffer level, each group we created at Noc level will read in those data.

![EyerissV2 Global Buffer Level](./diagrams/row-stationary-03.jpg)

### Compressed Sparse Column Data Format

Compressed Sparse Column is a data format used to jump zero-element MAC.

The CSC format used in this project is a little different from the original one.

![Example of compressing sparse weights with compressed sparse column (CSC) coding](https://images-cdn.shimo.im/dwf3TL2QC4EdrmXJ/image.png)

The picture above shows the one used in Eyeriss V2, but in this project it changes.

+ I used Zero Column Code to represent a zero column instead of repeat the value of next address vector element;
+ I used the row number in original matrix instead of the real 'count' vector;

Although it will decrease the size of matrix column with a pseudo-count vector, it is much simpler.

### The Length of Address Vectors and Data Vectors

When we use CSC format data, the length of both address vectors and data vectors are variable. 
So we cannot use the common way to stop reading or writing.

I use one zero `0` to show the end of one vector (one address vector or one data vector with count vector) 
at Scratch Pad level; I use two continuous zero `00` to show the end of one stream of vectors at SRAM bank level.
